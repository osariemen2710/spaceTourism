Short project README for the Space Tourism multi-page site built as a React + Vite app using Tailwind CSS.

## Overview

A responsive, multi-page static site that reproduces the Space Tourism Frontend Mentor design. The project demonstrates responsive layouts, a mobile-first workflow, and interactive UI patterns implemented with React and Tailwind CSS.

### The challenge

Build a multi-page site that:
- Presents an optimal layout for each page at mobile, tablet and desktop widths.
- Provides an accessible mobile navigation (hamburger -> slide-in menu with close icon).
- Shows hover and focus styles for interactive elements.
- Allows viewing and toggling content sections (destination, crew, technology) while matching the provided designs.

## Screenshot

- Tailwind CSS
- TypeScript

## How to run locally

Clone the repo, install dependencies and start the dev server.

PowerShell
```
cd space/spaceTs; pnpm install; pnpm run dev
```

Notes:
- This project uses Vite + React. If you prefer `pnpm` or `yarn`, adapt the commands accordingly.

## What I learned

- Implemented a responsive header with a hamburger menu that opens a slide-in navigation on small screens.
- Used Tailwind CSS utilities to implement mobile-first responsive layouts and background images per breakpoint.
- Managed simple UI state in React for menu toggling and content selection.

## Continued development

- Improve keyboard accessibility for the slide-in menu (trap focus while open).
- Add animation polish for the menu and active link transitions.
- Add unit tests for critical UI components.
